## <span style="font-size:80%">Lecture Overview</span> {.smaller}

- Discuss how FAIR principles enhance clarity and understanding of scientific visuals

- Framework for evaluating FAIR principles in the literature

- Overview of applied use cases

## <span style="font-size:80%">Applying FAIR Frameworks to Literature Evaluation and Synthesis Process</span> {.smaller}

- Figures and plots are lasting scientific records:

  - Scientific Journals/Publications

  - Trial dossiers

  - Clinical guidelines

- Readers should be able to trace the figure back to the following in order to validate findings:

  - Samples and measurable features used in dataset

  - Processing steps used to analyze data to generate figures

  - Statistical used to generate data points and uncertainty bands within the plot/figure

- Lack of metadata can lead to figures that’re unverifiable

Consider: Is the science understandable?

  - the core message must be recoverable without guessing

  - visual hierarchy must reveal what matters biologically

    - Strong effects are visually prioritized

    - Contextual or background elements fade into secondary prominence
    
    - Uncertainty and variability are visibly encoded, not hidden

  - Common hierarchy strategies

    - Color brightness to emphasize biomarkers with meaningful effect sizes
    
    - Line thickness for pathways with stronger evidence
    
    - Spatial grouping to reflect biological modules
    
    - domain expert should be able to articulate the clinical or mechanistic insight

## <span style="font-size:80%">Evaluating Visuals for Reusability and Scientific Rigor</span> {.smaller}

- Clarity: Can we see the scientific signal?

- Context: Do we know what we’re looking at?

- Accessibility: Who can interpret this accurately?

- FAIRness: Can others find, verify, and reuse it later?

Clarity: Can we see the scientific signal?

- Focus on signal vs. noise:

  - Are effect sizes visible?

  - Are uncertainty measures present?
  
  - Is the visual hierarchy guiding attention to key findings?

- Figure

  - Effect sizes are encoded clearly (dots along x‑axis)

  - Weight/precision is encoded via dot size and y‑position — making signal (effect size + uncertainty/weight) readily visible

Context: Do we know what we’re looking at?

A figure is incomplete without:

  - Units (mg/dL, TPM, odds ratio)

  - Sample/tumor type

  - Study identifiers (e.g., GSE####)

Figure: Expression data from TCGA correlates well with patient-specific RNA-Seq data

  - Sample/tissue type and units are provided

  - Senior authors listed at the top of two sub-panel images

  - Figures do not embed a GEO / GSE / dataset‑ID in the figure legend

Accessibility — Who can interpret this accurately?

Visual can be understood by:

  - Machine-readable tools for automation

  - Those without domain-specialized software

  - Figures should avoid bias and exclusion

  - Sample/tissue type and units are provided

  - Senior authors listed at the top of two sub-panel images

  - Figures do not embed a GEO / GSE / dataset‑ID in the figure legend

| Concept | Indicators in Figures |
|-----------|--------------|
| `Clarity` | Node size encodes gene-set size; edges (links) represent overlap between gene-sets — so you can visually assess which sets share many genes. The network layout groups similar gene-sets (pathways) so related functional themes cluster visually. |
| `Context` | Instead of simply listing enriched pathways in a long table, the network situates them in relation to each other — emphasizing functional redundancy or relatedness. The figure helps answer: which functional themes emerge when you consider overlap among enriched gene-sets? |

| `Accessibility` | For someone unfamiliar with the raw gene list, the network provides an at-a-glance overview of major functional themes.Graph simplifies interpretation by visually clustering related sets rather than hundreds of pathway names.|
| `FAIRness / Reusability` | Notes from legend and details within the article provides sufficient methodological detail to allow reuse of the workflow on new gene-lists.  |

## <span style="font-size:80%">Summary</span> {.smaller}

- Figures are lasting scientific evidence — they must be interpretable, traceable, and reusable across publications, regulatory submissions, and clinical decisions

- FAIR-aligned visuals ensure that signal is visible, context is explicit, and metadata enables reproducibility — reducing ambiguity and error in scientific interpretation

-By applying Clarity, Context, Accessibility, and FAIRness as a framework, we can strengthen both scientific rigor and real-world usability of biomedical discoveries
